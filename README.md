Functionality
The user and computer share a scoreboard with two point totals that increase when the respective player wins a point. When one side wins by scoring five points, the buttons stop responding until the player clicks the Play Again button. This is to allow the player to view the match history to see the progression of their game.

Thoughts:

Each time I clicked a button to choose a weapon, all three buttons were pressed. I ended up resolving the issue by adding separate event listeners to each of the three buttons, but this required many lines of code to implement. There must be a more optimized way and I will return to remedy this in the future when I'm more adept at programming. 

I started this project shortly after learning about DOM methods so trying to apply the information I learned caused some initial discomfort, but my confidence increased gradually with the hours I spent programming. 

Prior to programming this project, I made a rough sketch on paper of how I wanted the webpage to look. I believe this helped me progress through the project as I knew which subsequent elements to create after I was finished with a section.

I also added mobile responsiveness as I believe this is a game that can be easily played with a mobile device.
